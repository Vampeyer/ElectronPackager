To build your Electron application into a successful NSIS installer for a 64-bit Windows using electron-builder, you can follow these steps:

Configure electron-builder: Ensure that you have electron-builder installed in your project by running npm install electron-builder --save-dev if you haven't already. Next, create a build section in your package.json file with the required configuration for electron-builder. Here's an example:
json
Copy code
"build": {
  "appId": "com.example.myapp",
  "productName": "MyApp",
  "directories": {
    "output": "dist"
  },
  "win": {
    "target": [
      "nsis"
    ]
  }
}
Make sure to replace the appId and productName with your own values. The "target": ["nsis"] specifies that you want to build an NSIS installer for Windows.

Package your application: To package your Electron application, run the following command:
bash
Copy code
npx electron-builder build
This will create a folder named dist (or according to your specified output directory) containing the packaged application.

Install NSIS: Download and install the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) from the official website: https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download.

Create an NSIS script: In the root directory of your project,

& *** create a new file named installer.nsi 

(or any name you prefer) and add the following basic script:

nsis
Copy code
# Name of the installer
Outfile "Win0zXP.exe"

# Default section
Section

# Output directory and files to include
SetOutPath $INSTDIR
File /r "dist\*"

SectionEnd
You can modify the script to include additional customization as per your requirements.

Build the NSIS installer: Open a command prompt or terminal in the directory where your installer.nsi script is located and run the following command:
bash
Copy code

makensis installer.nsi



This command will compile the NSIS script and generate the MyAppInstaller.exe file.

Test the installer: Once the build process completes, you can test the installer by running the generated MyAppInstaller.exe file. It should install your Electron application on the 64-bit Windows machine.
These steps should help you build a successful NSIS installer for your Electron application using electron-builder. Remember to customize the configuration and NSIS script according to your project's specific requirements.
