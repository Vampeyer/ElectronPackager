You can modify the script to include additional customization as per your requirements.

Build the NSIS installer: Open a command prompt or terminal in the directory where your installer.nsi script is located and run the following command:
bash
Copy code
makensis installer.nsi
This command will compile the NSIS script and generate the MyAppInstaller.exe file.

Test the installer: Once the build process completes, you can test the installer by running the generated MyAppInstaller.exe file. It should install your Electron application on the 64-bit Windows machine.
These steps should help you build a successful NSIS installer for your Electron application using electron-builder. Remember to customize the configuration and NSIS script according to your project's specific requirements.

show me an example of code that would run perfectly well , and in the nsis installer  ,it would check if node was installed or not during the installation , and if not , too download it automatically , then proceed with the installation.

Certainly! Here's an example of an NSIS script that checks if Node.js is installed during the installation process and automatically downloads it if it's not found:

nsis
Copy code
# Name of the installer
Outfile "MyAppInstaller.exe"

# Request application privileges for Windows Vista and above
RequestExecutionLevel admin

# Variables
Var NodeInstalled

# Check if Node.js is already installed
Function CheckNodeInstalled
  ReadRegStr $NodeInstalled HKLM "SOFTWARE\Node.js" "" $R0
  StrCmp $R0 "" NotInstalled
  StrCmp $R0 "Installed" Installed
  StrCmp $R0 "Installed (x64)" Installed
  NotInstalled:
    MessageBox MB_OK "Node.js is not installed. It will be downloaded and installed automatically."
    ExecWait 'https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/win-x64/node.exe' $EXEDIR\node.exe
    Goto Installed
  Installed:
FunctionEnd

# Default section
Section

# Call the Node.js installation check function
Call CheckNodeInstalled

# Output directory and files to include
SetOutPath $INSTDIR
File /r "dist\*"

SectionEnd
In this script, the CheckNodeInstalled function checks if Node.js is installed by checking the registry for the presence of the Node.js key. If it's not found, a message box is displayed to inform the user that Node.js will be downloaded and installed automatically. The ExecWait command downloads the Node.js executable from the official website and saves it in the installation directory.

You can include this code in your installer.nsi script, and when running the installer, it will automatically check for Node.js and download it if necessary before proceeding with the installation of your Electron application.

Note: The above example assumes a 64-bit Windows installation. If you need to support other architectures or want to handle edge cases, you may need to modify the script accordingly.
