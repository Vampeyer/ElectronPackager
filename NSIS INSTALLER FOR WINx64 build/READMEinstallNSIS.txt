how do I take an existing , working , electron application that I am working on developing on , and build that into a successful nsis installer for a 64 bit windows, while using electron-build ?

To build your Electron application into a successful NSIS installer for a 64-bit Windows using electron-builder, you can follow these steps:

Configure electron-builder: Ensure that you have electron-builder installed in your project by running npm install electron-builder --save-dev if you haven't already. Next, create a build section in your package.json file with the required configuration for electron-builder. Here's an example:
json
Copy code
"build": {
  "appId": "com.example.myapp",
  "productName": "MyApp",
  "directories": {
    "output": "dist"
  },
  "win": {
    "target": [
      "nsis"
    ]
  }
}
Make sure to replace the appId and productName with your own values. The "target": ["nsis"] specifies that you want to build an NSIS installer for Windows.

Package your application: To package your Electron application, run the following command:
bash
Copy code
npx electron-builder build
This will create a folder named dist (or according to your specified output directory) containing the packaged application.

Install NSIS: Download and install the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS)
 from the official website: https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download.

Create an NSIS script: In the root directory of your project,
 create a new file named installer.nsi (or any name you prefer) and add the following basic script:

nsis
Copy code
# Name of the installer
Outfile "MyAppInstaller.exe"

# Default section
Section

# Output directory and files to include
SetOutPath $INSTDIR
File /r "dist\*"

SectionEnd
You can modify the script to include additional customization as per your requirements.

Build the NSIS installer: Open a command prompt or terminal in the directory where your
 installer.nsi script is located and run the following command:
bash
Copy code
***   ----      makensis installer.nsi          into command line  



This command will compile the NSIS script and generate the MyAppInstaller.exe file.

Test the installer: Once the build process completes, you can test the installer by running
 the generated MyAppInstaller.exe file. It should install your Electron application on the 64-bit Windows machine.
These steps should help you build a successful NSIS installer for your Electron application using electron-builder. Remember to customize the configuration and NSIS script according to your project's specific requirements.

show me an example of code that would run perfectly well , and in the nsis installer  
,it would check if node was installed or not during the installation , and if not , too download 
it automatically , then proceed with the installation.

Certainly! Here's an example of an NSIS script that checks if Node.js is installed during the
 installation process and automatically downloads it if it's not found:

nsis
Copy code
# Name of the installer
Outfile "MyAppInstaller.exe"

# Request application privileges for Windows Vista and above
RequestExecutionLevel admin

# Variables
Var NodeInstalled

# Check if Node.js is already installed
Function CheckNodeInstalled
  ReadRegStr $NodeInstalled HKLM "SOFTWARE\Node.js" "" $R0
  StrCmp $R0 "" NotInstalled
  StrCmp $R0 "Installed" Installed
  StrCmp $R0 "Installed (x64)" Installed
  NotInstalled:
    MessageBox MB_OK "Node.js is not installed. It will be downloaded and installed automatically."
    ExecWait 'https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/win-x64/node.exe' $EXEDIR\node.exe
    Goto Installed
  Installed:
FunctionEnd

# Default section
Section

# Call the Node.js installation check function
Call CheckNodeInstalled

# Output directory and files to include
SetOutPath $INSTDIR
File /r "dist\*"

SectionEnd
In this script, the CheckNodeInstalled function checks if Node.js is installed by
checking the registry for the presence of the Node.js key. If it's not found, a message box 
is displayed to inform the user that Node.js will be downloaded and installed automatically.
 The ExecWait command downloads the Node.js executable from the official website and saves it in the installation directory.

You can include this code in your installer.nsi script, and when running the installer,
 it will automatically check for Node.js and download it if necessary before proceeding with
 the installation of your Electron application.

Note: The above example assumes a 64-bit Windows installation. If you need to support other 
architectures or want to handle edge cases, you may need to modify the script accordingly.
